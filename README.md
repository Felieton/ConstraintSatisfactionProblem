# Constraint satisfaction problem

## Intro
CSP is problem in which one must find solution/values for a group of variables that fulfill a given set of restrictions or rules.

## About
This project provides solutions to two problems: Map coloring problem and Einstein riddle (Zebra Problem). The solution compares algorithms of Backtracking and Forward checking: its times of execution and nodes visited based on different parameteres.
The full report of this comparison is present in the file "CSP - report"
